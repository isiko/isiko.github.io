# Hey!
You made it to my homepage! I hope there's a bit more content here when you see this, because I tend to put stuff off :D
On this site I'll try to write a little bit about my projects, so if there's not much content you can head over to my Github profile, which you can find in the top menu, and look around there until I've done more here.

But I should probably introduce myself first. I'm Isaac, a student from NRW who has a lot of fun programming and publishing his results on Github.
On this page I will post updates about my projects and eventually about me and what I'm doing. 

You can reach me at 'koerner@informatik-ag.net', so write me an E-Mail about how you found my Page and what you think about it
